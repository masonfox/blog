# Overview
Our duck run was a **smelly** and **muddy** mess... A haven for fly breeding and duck muck lovers, it needed a renovation!

We also used this opportunity to replace our blue kiddie pool with a framed and drained stock tank! Going into winter, we knew that we wanted to de-ice the pool and that kiddie pool wouldn't handle the warmer.

In the end, for our 8x8 run, it took 24 bags of sand and 28 bags of gravel! 💪

# Background
We have an [8x8 poultry run](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/producers-pride-universal-poultry-pen-8-ft-x-8-ft-cr0808-1333983) for our ducks. We bought it last year, plopped it down, and the ducks made it into a bog rather quickly. It began to smell, it seemed like it never dried out, and the ducks would dig holes everywhere with their beaks, especially around the pool.

It was a mess and we knew we needed to fix it.

# The Renovation

## Excavation
We were targeting 1.5" of gravel for drainage and about 2.5" of sand for the ground covering, so we dug down 4" and leveled that out. It was incredible to see what amounted to about an inch of "muck film" that sat on top of the dirt as we dug in. 🤢

Once we got that done, we started working on the stock tank.

## Duck Pool

### Stock Tank
We purchased a [50-gallon Stock Tank](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/rubbermaid-structural-foam-stock-tanks-50-gal-capacity-2229927) from Tractor Supply as our kiddie pool upgrade. We weren't confident of the exact volume of the kiddie pool, but we expected that we'd be able to fit 4+ ducks comfortably in this new tank at a time, so we pulled the trigger on that. We went back and forth on a 70 or 100 gallon tank. However, the larger tanks *only* expand the depth, and we wanted to make entering and exiting accessible for the ducks, so we thought the we went with the low-profile 50-gallon tank.

### Pool Framing
Since we had issues with the ducks pooling water around the kiddie pool, we decided to **frame in** our pool and backfill it with 4" of gravel. That way *when* they splash, it'll drain directly. Additionally, in the past, our ducks liked to dig in the dirt around the pool while they drank from it, leaving holes around it that filled with water and also making the water muddy. We anticipated that they'd do the same with the sand, so investing in the frame felt worth it.

The framing was just two ground-contact `2x6x8s` that we cut at 58" and 38", a good balance of width and length for the splash zone. We secured that square with 3" deck screws and dropped it right on the excavated floor.

### Drainage
I'd previously built a drainage pipe connected to a sink strainer drain for our kiddie pool as something of a "proof of concept"; we knew that the kiddie pool was always going to be a *temporary* solution. Fortunately, the drainage pipe and fitting were intact, enabling us to re-purpose it. However, we did adapt our drain unit specifically!

We'd previously used a [spring style sink strainer](https://www.menards.com/main/kitchen/sink-sprayers-strainer-baskets/plumb-works-reg-stainless-kitchen-sink-strainer-basket/6791141/p-1444450903940-c-8506.htm), but after frequent uses, the spring mechanism in the strainer bent constantly, making it difficult to replace the strainer after cleaning the pool. This time around, we went with a [screw style](https://www.menards.com/main/kitchen/sink-sprayers-strainer-baskets/plumb-works-reg-turn-2-stainless-steel-kitchen-sink-strainer-basket/pf0291/p-4300927234311048-c-8506.htm) strainer, and so far, it's made a notable improvement!

Therefore, I **highly** recommend the screw-style strainers if you're going to do something similar.

Due to the pool frame, though, we needed to bore a hole though the frame. We just used a 3" round drill bit. Honestly, this was the hardest part! 😅 However, cutting from both sides was enough to punch it through. It gave our 1.5" drain pipe some wiggle room.

## Gravel
After finishing the pool, we dropped and the remaining gravel and sand within the run. We ended up adding 6 more bags of gravel than we'd originally planned for, as we felt like we'd regret skipping on the drainage otherwise.

## Sand & Finished 🎉
Last but not least, the ground covering: sand! 🏜️

And here's the finished product (from that evening):
