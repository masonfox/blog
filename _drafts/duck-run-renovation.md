# Overview
Our duck run was a **smelly** and **muddy** mess... A haven for fly breeding and duck muck lovers, it needed a renovation!

We also used this opportunity to replace our tiny blue kiddie pool with a framed and drained stock tank!

# Background
We have an [8x8 poultry run](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/producers-pride-universal-poultry-pen-8-ft-x-8-ft-cr0808-1333983)...
